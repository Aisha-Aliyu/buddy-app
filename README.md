## Overview

Buddy is a responsive, client-side mental health web app that helps users track their moods, vent safely, chat with an AI‐powered companion, set emergency contacts, and access wellness tools (meditations, inspirations, etc.).  

This project demonstrates frontend architecture, local persistence, charts, and PWA capabilities, making it a great portfolio piece for recruiters.

cd buddy-app

2. (Optional) If you later add a Node/Express backend, initialize dependencies:
npm install

3. Start a local server (for static HTML/JS, you can use something like live-server or http-server):
npx http-server . -p 3000

4. Visit http://localhost:3000/homepage.html (or your entry file) in your browser.

🚀 Deployment (Done via Vercel)
 • The project is connected to GitHub and auto-deploys on pushes to main.
 • Vercel hosts the static frontend, which supports PWA installs through the manifest & service-worker (if you add one later).

✅ What to Extend Next
 • Backend / Database for real user data, chat logic, and auth.
 • Notifications / SMS API for real emergency alerts.
 • Serverless Functions to power AI chat or sync data.
 • Service Worker / Caching to make Buddy work offline.
 • Analytics / Logging to track user engagement.
